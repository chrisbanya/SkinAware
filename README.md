#SkinAware - An Ai-powered tool for early skin condition detection and awareness.

OVERVIEW

SkinAware is a web-based medical diagnostic tool that allows users to upload images of their skin concerns and receive instant AI-powered feedback on possible skin conditions. The system helps individuals—especially those with darker skin tones—gain early insight into common dermatological issues and make informed decisions about seeking professional care.

PROBLEM STATEMENT (PAIN POINT):

Millions of Nigerians experience skin conditions but lack immediate access to dermatologists. This is particularly true in rural areas, low-income communities, or regions where medical professionals are scarce. Moreover, traditional diagnostic tools and datasets  are often underrepresent darker skin tones, leading to misdiagnosis or late detection of serious conditions like melanoma.
Key pain points:
~ Lack of immediate access to expert dermatological advice.

~ Underrepresentation of darker skin in dermatology datasets.

~ Difficulty in distinguishing between harmless vs. serious skin concerns.

~ Anxiety and misinformation from self-diagnosis via search engines.


TARGET AUDIENCE

~ Individuals experiencing skin issues (e.g., rashes, acne, discoloration).

~ People with dark or richly pigmented skin who may face diagnostic bias.

~ Rural or underserved populations without easy access to specialists.

~ General users who want quick, reliable, and educational feedback.


PROPOSED SOLUTION

SkinAware will provide an easy-to-use interface where users:

~ Upload a photo of a skin issue.

~ Receive feedback from an AI model trained on diverse dermatological image data.

~ Get possible condition matches and suggested next steps (e.g., "consult a dermatologist", "try OTC remedy ").

~ Learn how skin conditions manifest differently across skin tones.
